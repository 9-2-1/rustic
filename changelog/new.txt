Changes in version x.x.x:

Breaking changes:

Bugs fixed:
- restore: Warm-up options given by the command line didn't work. This has been fixed.

- diff: The options --no-atime and --ignore-devid had no effect and are now removed.

- forget: Using "-1" as value for --keep-* options will keep all snapshots of that interval
- prune: Added option --repack-all
- Option --dry-run is now a global option and can also be defined in the config file or via env variable

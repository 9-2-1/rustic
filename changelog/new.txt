Breaking changes:

Bugs fixed:

New features:
- New global configuration paths are available, located at /etc/rustic/*.toml or %PROGRAMDATA%/rustic/config/*.toml, depending on your platform.

- restore: The restore algorithm has been improved and should now be faster for remote repositories.
- restore: Files are now allocated just before being first processed. This allows easier resumed restores.

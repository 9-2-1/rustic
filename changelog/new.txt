Changes in version x.x.x:

Breaking changes:

Bugs fixed:

New features:
- New global configuration paths are available, located at /etc/rustic/*.toml or %PROGRAMDATA%/rustic/config/*.toml, depending on your platform.
- REST backend: Now allows to use custom TLS root certificates.
- restore: The restore algorithm has been improved and should now be faster for remote repositories.
- restore: Files are now allocated just before being first processed. This allows easier resumed restores.
- New option: `no-require-git` for backup - if enabled, a git repository is not required to apply `git-ignore` rule.
- fix: wait for password-command to successfully exit, allowing to input something into the command, and read password from stdout.
